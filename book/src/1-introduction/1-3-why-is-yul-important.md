# Why Is Yul Important?

---

During the smart contract development process, there are actions, or manipulations which are not feasible for the 
programmer from the high-level Solidity code. Using Yul, the programmer is given much more fine-grained control over 
the storage, memory and in some cases `calldata` layout of the EVM. This control also allows for much more gas efficient code to be written.

The flexibility and gas optimization of Yul are what makes it important.
