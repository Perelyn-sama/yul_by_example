# What Is Yul?

---

Yul is an intermediate language that compiles to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode. It is designed to be a 
low-level language that gives developers a high degree of control over the execution of their smart contracts. It is 
similar in many ways to Assembly but with higher-level features that make it easier to work with. [[2](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/ethereum-development/smart-contracts/what-is-yul#what-is-yul)]

Yul was previously called **Julia** or **Iulia**.

Within the context of smart contract development, Yul is usually referred to as **Inline Assembly**. As it is very 
similar to Assembly and is written within functions in smart contract code.
