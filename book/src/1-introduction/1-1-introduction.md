# Introduction _(What is this book about?)_

Hello there!

This is a book about Yul, a low-level, intermediate language written alongside Solidity that can be compiled to bytecode for different backends [[1](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html#yul)].

Over the course of this book, we are going to go through what Yul is, why it is important, its advantage and disadvantage over Solidity and its implementations in a smart contract.

Also, we will see how storage and memory are laid out in Solidity and how we would harness the power of Yul to infiltrate and modify to our taste.

Enjoy!
