# Yul Actions

In this section of the book, we will take a look at how to do basic stuff in Yul. From basic things like addition to loops, to hashing, checking of balances and even signature verification.

Feel free to recreate or rerun the codes written here on Remix.

> ðŸ’¡ Solidity functions written from here on will return bytes32 to basically show the hexadecimals stored in either storage or memory. You can change the return types and rerun the code on Remix and Solidity will automatically cast it to the return type.
