# `int8`, `int128`, `int256`

While `uint[n]` types can only contain positive integers, the `int[n]` types can contain both positive and negative numbers. As you know, `int[n]` variables store numbers ranging from `-1 -> -(2 ^ (n-1))` on the negative side, and `0 -> (2^n) - 1` on the positive side. This means that for the three `int[n]` types specified above, this would be their minimum and maximum values.

| **`int[n]` type** | **Minimum Value** | **Maximum Value** |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `int8`            | -128              | 127               |
| `int128`          | -2^127            | (2^127) - 1       |
| `int256`          | -2^255            | (2^255) - 1       |

When it comes to storage of `int[n]` types, the positive values range from `0x00` in hex, (with the number of bytes after `0x` corresponding to the number of bytes of the `int[n]` type) up till `0x7f`. While the negative numbers range from `0xff` to `0x80` backwards. It is reasonable as `0xff` is greater than `0x80` on hexadecimal face value, so is `-1` greater than `-128` on the decimal scale.

| Value  | Value  | Value  |     | Value  | Value  | Value  |
|--------|--------|--------|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| 0      | 1      | 2      | ... | 125    | 126    | 127    |
| `0x00` | `0x01` | `0x02` | ... | `0x7d` | `0x7e` | `0x7f` |
| -1     | -2     | -3     | ... | 126    | 127    | -128   |
| `0xff` | `0xfe` | `0xfd` | ... | `0x82` | `0x81` | `0x80` |

`int[n]` types are packed in a similar way, just like their `uint[n]` counterparts.

You can try to store different `int[n]` types on Remix to see their storage layouts.
