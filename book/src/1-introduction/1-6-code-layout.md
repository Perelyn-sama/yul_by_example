# Code Layout

Every piece of Yul code written here can be rerun on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Remix is an online smart contract development suite. It also offers a way of observing the process of EVM layouts and storage. It will be used over the course of this book, and you can replicate whatever we have done here on the suite.
